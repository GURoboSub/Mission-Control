# Mission-Control
Code used on the linux mission control computer.

This code allows us to properly test and debug our submarine's functionality, as well as allow for autonomous missions to be ran. In the future, we plan to add image processing features with OpenCV and machine learning using custom SVM algorithms.

The code was built using Netbeans IDE 8.2, and is given in the form of a Netbeans project.
